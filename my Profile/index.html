        <h2>About me: </h2>
        <img src="jether7.jpg" class= "pic3" alt= "jether">
        Hello! My name is Jether John Apalla Mendoza, 20 years old from San Nicolas, Villasis, Pangasinan. I am the youngest son of Mr. Domingo C. Mendoza and Mrs. Nora A. Mendoza; I have two siblings named Jethro A. Mendoza and Joanna Bless A. Mendoza.  I am a jolly person; I love adventures and I love to travel and to hang out with my family and friends. I have a lot of hobbies like playing basketball, badminton, online games, and biking, I also love to sing, to dance, and to play instruments like guitar, ukulele, and drums. I am the head of the KKB triune movers here in Villasis, I teach dance every Saturday and Sunday. My ambition is to become a captain of a ship but my parents did not allow me to take the course that I want in college so I just take Bachelor of Science In Information and Technology instead of Bachelor of Science in Marine Transportation, even though I did not get the course that I want I am still happy on my course right now, I am enjoying programming and designing and I know that God has a plan for me like what he said in Jeremiah 29:11. I have a lot of friends  and I am so blessed to have them because I am so really happy with them, sadly I cannot hang out with all of them right know because of this pandemic but at least I still have some friends that I can hang out with. Right now, I am trying to focus on my studies because honestly, I am not good on to this path that I am running right now but I will do my very best until I finish this race, I know that I can do it because is with me.
